## Housing vs. Stop and Frisk

**Analyze how real estate values correlate stop and frisk frequencies**  

**Data**: NYC Stop and Frisk data , Zillow Housing Value Index (ZHVI)  (time series by neighbourhood or zip code)  

Hypothesis: Higher real estate values related to a lower frequency of stops/lower usage of violence. Moreover, we want to investigate whether the real estate value of neighbouring areas are correlated with the number of stops. In other words, how do two neighbourhoods that have the same real estate value but have a different composition of surrounding neighbourhoods, compare in terms of stops distribution?   

We also want to explore one of the following ideas:  

**compare the different distribution of house prices/ stops throughout the years that we have data. investigate how stops frequency and distribution varied i neighbourhoods that underwent gentrification or large (relative) change in real estate value during these years**
